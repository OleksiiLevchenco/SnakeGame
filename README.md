# SnakeGame

Once there was a snake, and it got hungry. You can easily guess what happend next ;)

This is my first game in Java.
I tryed to implement design patterns and OOP princeples.

The main goal of the game is to eat all the apples.
The more apples there are on the field - the faster they appear.
If their number becomes greater than the critical value - you lose.

Also I implemented field area adjustment, pause mode, "new game" and "game over".

I've finished it a long time ago. Today I would change a few things in it, but I've decided to leave it as it is.
